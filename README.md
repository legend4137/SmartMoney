## 2. Cloning the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/legend4137/SmartMoney.git
cd SmartMoney
```
## 3. Environment Setup:
   
### Database Configuration

Follow these steps to set up the necessary databases and environment variables for the project.

#### 1. Create a Firebase Database

1. Log in to the Firebase console.
2. Create a new project or use an existing one.
3. Navigate to the **Firestore Database** section.
4. Create a new database and name it **`formSubmissions`**.
5. In the Firebase console, go to **Project Settings** > **Service Accounts**.
6. Click on **Generate new private key** to download a JSON file containing your Firebase credentials.
7. Place this JSON file in your `.env` file.

#### 2. Create a MongoDB Database

1. Set up a MongoDB cluster using MongoDB Atlas or run a local MongoDB server.
2. Create a database named **`test`**.
3. Inside the `test` database, create a collection called **`wallets`**.
4. Obtain your MongoDB connection string (API key).
5. Add the MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file with the variable name **`MONGODB_KEY`**.

#### 3. Create a Gemini API Key

1. Register on the Gemini platform and create a new API key.
2. Add the Gemini API key to the `.env` file with the variable name **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**.

#### 4. Setting Up the `.env` File

1. Create a `.env` file in the **server** folder of your project.
2. Add the JSON file that you downloaded earlier and the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = `{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "project_id",
    "private_key_id": "private_key_id",
    "private_key": "private_key"
    "client_email": "client_email",
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "auth_uri": "auth_uri",
    "token_uri": "toekn_uri",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "auth_provider",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "client_cert_url",
    "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }`
    MONGODB_KEY = "mongo_uri"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    JWT_SECRET=CHAD_RAID_2024
    ```

- Ensure the `.env` file is included in the server folder.
- **Important:** Do not commit the `.env` file to version control to keep your API keys secure.
